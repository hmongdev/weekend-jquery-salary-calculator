# PROJECT NAME
jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 4 hours base, 4 hours stretch_

What this app does:
This application allows you to add employees to a table, remove employees, and calculates the montly costs of hiring/firing them.

WHAT problems I encountered, and HOW I solved the problem:

1. Grabbing the annualSalary and adding them together
Grabbing values and displaying them to the DOM were easy. The first problem I encountered was summing all the employees' annual salaries. At first, I thought I could grab each employee's salary individually with jQuery, but that took too much work. Then I remembered our album collection assignment and how we created an album object with properties that we pushed into an array of albums. I essentially wanted to collect the objects, then specifically target the annual salary and add them together.
